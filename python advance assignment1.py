# # Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?

# The main thing that comes into picture when we tak about OOPS concept is all about the CLASS and OBJECTS.
# 
# The main purpose to use this class and object is to get the reusability of code under a single class.
# 
# 
# The main aim is to implement real entitites like inheritance,polymorphism,encapsulation.

# # Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?

# Inheritance is the procress in which one class inherits the properties of the other class.
# 
# 
# 
# Mainly the properties are called attributes.Here the transfer of attributes takes from a parent class .And the class which inherit the attributes are called child class

# # Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?

# MAinly the class is an blueprint tht is made for the further involvment with the code.Where as the instance object is the one that is real and being used as a class object.

# # Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?

# # The first argument of the class including the init method shows that it is the first instance of the class.And from here the inherite properties transfers to the child classes.

# # Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?

# The main purpose of init method is that it creates a pointer with respect to every element that is being passed.
# 
# 
# init usually represents as __init(self,"a","b")
# 
# 
# here self is the pointer where it point outs the every element

# # Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?

# Create a class.....with using the keyword called class
# 
# 
# call the class using a class name and assign it to a variable.
# 
# 
# 
# pass what ever arguments required using __init__
# 
# 
# 

# # Q7. What is the process for creating a class?

# The process of creating a class starts with the 
# 
# 1) create a class using a keyword called class. Give suitable name to the class.
# 
# 
# 

# # Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?

# The class from which the class inherits is called a superclass or parentclass
